## Decentralized AGI
**AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** refers to an advanced form of artificial intelligence capable of understanding, learning, and performing any intellectual task that a human can do. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks (e.g., facial recognition, language translation), AGI possesses human-like cognitive abilities, allowing it to reason, adapt, and solve complex problems across different domains without human intervention.

Decentralized **AGI, powered by blockchain and community collaboration**, ensures **security, transparency, and fairness** in AI development. Blockchain **encrypts and protects data, ensuring user privacy** while distributing control and enhancing trust through immutable records and smart contracts. **With collective strength, AGI evolves securely and equitably**, shaping a **scalable and privacy-first AI ecosystem** for the future.
